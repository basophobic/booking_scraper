      "They handled the actual situation professional.\n",

      "8. The view was amazing thank you\n",

      "3. A very good hotel, the room was spotless, with an excellent view. Quality fittings throughout, with a rather fancy bathroom. Very comfy bed. Great sleep. Very solid breakfast, will definitely set you up for the day. Great food to be had in Delphi, just ask at reception. Overall, highly recommended. You won't be disappointed.\n",

      "3. Location wise, can walk to the site. Good value. Big space for lobby and excellent hospitality!\n",

      "12. Smallish rooms would be the only negative comment.\n",
      "13. The hotel is situated on the main road in in the town, about 5 mins drive to the Delphi site. The room was clean and well appointed. The staff helpful.\n",
      "14. Generally all was ok, the parking is a little difficult to get in and out off.\n",
      "15. Really nice property in the heart of the town. View from our balcony was stunning.\n",
      "16. Street car parking was a challenge.\n",
      "17. Very comfortable room with an amazing view. The hotel is located directly in the heart of Delfi, on the same streets than some nice taverns and only a five minute walk from Delhi’s historical site. We have been welcomed very friendly and were offered free parking. The breakfast was very good. Everything from yoghurt, to omelette and bread was served. Would strongly recommend this hotel!\n",
      "18. Location Seemed like a 3-4 star hotel with great service Awesome helpful staff Very good breakfast for cheap\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Very clean with great location and fantastic view.\n",
      "2. The location was superb. Do always book a room with a view (you pay a little extra). The views are absolutely stunning. The hotel is so well situated and it takes only about 20 minutes to walk to the site of Delphi and 5 minutes or so less to the museum. Do go to the house by the church as Greece's best literary person. Well worth the walk. Overall a well placed hotel, clean, modern and a \"room with a view\"!\n",
      "3. There were tea and coffee facilities in the room, although the items were not refreshed daily, but you could help yourself to sachets at breakfast, but had to always ask for milk. Bathroom rather unsafe as the shower is situated within a bath and there is no grip rail or bath mat. A little noisy from the road with continuous coaches going to Delphi.\n",
      "4. Excellent beds\n",
      "5. 😊\n",
      "6. Manager Babis was most friendly and helpful in contacting a courier company in Amissa on my behalf and advising where to pick up the item I had been sent. He is a hotel manager who cares about his guests. The hotel is located on the main street of Delphi town and is rare in having off street parking, about 50m away. It is about 20min walk to the archeological site.\n",
      "7. Great location - 10 mins walk to ancient Delphi sites - in centre of village\n",
      "8. Everything\n",
      "9. Fantastic view from the balcony, and very close to ancient Delphi. Clean room, with a very comfortable bed. Really handy that there was off-street parking for guests.\n",
      "10. Not a major gripe for one night’s stay, but the shower and screen were definitely in the wrong place from each other! (The shower was on the left of the bath, the screen on the right, so the water ended up on the bathroom floor...)\n",
      "11. Very beautiful view. I this love place.\n",
      "12. Off street parking available, friendly staff, very clean, rooms with a view and excellent breakfast!!\n",
      "13. Comfortable bed, silent air conditioning in night mode, modern design\n",
      "14. The shower glass is too small and the water is spreading over the floor, impossible to do otherwise\n"

The room was just right, the bed comfy and the aircon effective, although a bit noisy. The room, bathroom and hotel are very clean, and the staff very helpful. There is a small car park, be sure to reserve a space if you need one as it is hard to find one otherwise in the town should you be there during the peak season. The hotel also offer a 10% discount with a local taverna, this is highly recommended as there is a very good selection of local foods. The hotel's location means you can walk to the Delphi archaeological site without having to drive, as well as to any other part of the town, which is very convenient.\n",

The room was clean and it was nice to sit on the balcony in the evening and sip a glass of wine. The archaeological site with the museum is in walking distance (10 min).

      "5. Fedriades Delphi Hotel, is in an excellent location for the bus stop which is only a 5 minute walk away and the view across the valley. While the room was clean, it was just okay in terms of space and functionality. That being said, the service from staff was outstanding, we were made to feel very welcome. They have a fantastic set up in the reception area for guests, this space is very large with lots of comfortable chairs and coffee tables, as well as a dining table with chairs, with access to toilets and internet. Our bus didn’t leave until mid afternoon and we had exhausted our time in Delphi, this space was excellent to sit and read or catch on photos etc. until we had to leave. Would stay here again.\n",

The lobby has a spacious but cosy seating area, great for lounging around in. The receptionist Anna was so warm, friendly and helpful - she is a great asset to the hotel. She’s the best!\n",

Surprisingly... our room is on the 4th floor with special elevator entrance... wow.. didn't realize it when booking... room is specious for 3 of us and the view from the room is magnificent... If you 1st timer and probably this is 1st and last time visiting Delphi.. book this hotel and family suite room ..you never regret it... hey once a life time.. the receptikn also friendly and smooth check in and out... superb..\n",

      "8. We went to Delphi as a short side-trip from Athens and loved every minute - the public bus service was low-cost and very comfortable. Our primary reasons for the visit was to see some of the country outside Athens and, of course, to visit the place of The Oracle. Neither was a disappointment, the museum and historical area is very close (walking distance) from town and well organised, but both close early in the afternoon. The town is quite small and the Fedriades hotel is conveniently close to the center, clean and well-appointed. We went at a quiet time of year and received a free room upgrade (with view!) so the staff get top points! We recommend a quick bus trip down to Itea.\n",

Downstairs in the reception area was a hot and cold water supply for drinks and a tea box left but again, no milk. On asking for some, we were met with a less than helpful reply and a cold attitude from the young woman on duty. I would advise asking for this service in advance of arrival. Parking was a little confusing. Don't park on the opposite side of the road or you'll be fined. This info should be given in advance I feel.\n",

      "10. The Breakfest Buffet was awesome, everything you might want was there, very good! They gave us a free upgrade to a room with view upon arrival. We had a room in the 2nd floor, and had partly good view. The higher your room number (rooms with view) the better. 3rd floor should be best, and the view is definitly worth it. The room was small, but you won't stay there longer than 1 night, maximum 2, so it is okay.\n",

Un plateau bouilloire est mis à disposition mais si par chance il y a un sachet de café le premier jour, il n'est pas renouvelé, du coup on se demande pourquoi le proposer. Le personnel est lui aussi assorti à l'hôtel et cache mal son ennui.
